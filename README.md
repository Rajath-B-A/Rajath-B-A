### 👋🏽 Hi there, I'm Rajath

I’m currently making strides as a **SSE  at Accenture**, where I’ve developed interactive UIs, built REST APIs, optimized high-cost queries,  and Reduced code complexity using AI Agents to deliver robust, efficient solutions.

🚀✨ With specialised training in **Data Science & Machine Learning**, my passion for building intelligent systems drives my work in **software development and machine learning**. I thrive at the intersection of engineering and machine learning, where code meets data-driven insights.

### 🧠 Technical Expertise:
- **Languages & Frameworks**: Python, SQL 
- **Machine Learning & AI**: Proficient with Scikit-Learn, Langraph, Agentic AI  
- **Data Analysis & Visualisation**: Excel, Tableau, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

🛠️💡 I have developed scalable REST APIs, crafted complex SQL procedures, and implemented and maintained Azure pipelines. My work emphasises building resilient systems, and I have mentored junior developers and led multiple releases from start to finish.
